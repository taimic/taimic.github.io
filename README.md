#### Personal Portfolio Website Template ####

Super simple, fast and easy to create a personal portfolio webpage and host it on GitHub-Pages.

### Usage ###

Fork this repo, and in your fork, switch to the gh-pages branch. Edit the values in `js/config.js` to fit your personal needs.
Add images to the `img` directory and add their references to `config.images`. If you choose to create your own stylesheet, add
it to the `css` directory, and change `config.style` to the name of your css file.
The completed page will be available at `https://<username>.github.com/portfolio`.
