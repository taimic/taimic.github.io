# portfolio-template
This is a basic Github pages portfolio template for people just starting out.

**If you fork this repo**

make sure to rename it to `username.github.io`

gh pages takes awhile to render so give it 10-15ish minutes.

**If you have a domain**

just add your website name to the CNAME file like `www.example.com`
